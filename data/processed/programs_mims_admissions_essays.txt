How do I craft a response that accurately describes me? How do I demonstrate that MIMS is the right program for me? If any of these questions make you nervous, don’t fear! The good news is that writing your essays is completely within your control. Regardless of your GPA, work experience, or what your recommenders say — your essays are a blank slate. This is your chance to add another dimension to your application and spark the admission committee’s interest. Who are you as an individual? What are you most passionate about? What will you bring to our community? How do your goals connect with the MIMS program and the I School?Statement of PurposeThe Statement of Purpose is your opportunity to convince us that you belong uniquely in MIMS. This statement should focus on your preparation, experience, career goals, and reasons for choosing MIMS. The most successful statements convey strong motivation, competence, and potential as a graduate student.Tip #1Be specific. Make it clear, with examples, that you understand MIMS and that you are certain MIMS is the right program for you. Clearly define your goals and convey how MIMS will help you achieve them.Tip #2Your statement should be clear and concise. We recommend you aim for 1–2 pages with well-selected words rather than a longer essay with less clarity and poor organization.Tip #3Once you have a draft, ask for feedback from someone who knows you well.Need more guidance? Check out Graduate Division’sGuide to Writing the Statement of Purpose,Preparing Your Application for Graduate School, andGetting into Graduate School recordings.Personal History EssayThe Personal History Statement is a chance for you to connect with us on a more personal level. Although the content of this essay is a bit more open ended, we encourage you to address one or several of the prompts below:How you have overcome barriers to access higher educationHow you have come to understand the barriers faced by othersYour academic service to advance equitable access to high education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher educationYour research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequalityYour leadership among such groupsTip #1The Personal History Essay is your opportunity to share any experiences that show your promise, initiative, and ability to persevere despite obstacles. It should complement, not duplicate, the content in your Statement of Purpose.Tip #2If there is something important that happened to you that affected your grades, such as poverty, illness, or excessive work, state it. Write it affirmatively, demonstrating your perseverance and determination.Tip #3If the creative juices just aren’t flowing, there’s no reason to waste your time running in place. Instead, use this time to start working on other parts of your application. Or, step away completely and take a breather.Need more guidance? Check out the Graduate Division’sGuide to Writing the Personal Statement,Preparing Your Application for Graduate School, andGetting into Graduate School recordings.Short Answer EssayThe Short Answer Essay is a short response to this question:What is the most interesting information problem you have ever solved? Explain why it was interesting and how you solved it.The most successful essays clearly illustrate candidates’ quantitative aptitude, problem solving abilities, and written communication skills.Tip #1Reflect on your professional and/or academic experiences to identify one specific, impactful example that showcases your analytical skills.Tip #2As you guessed from the essay name, this response is meant to be short! Limit your response to 300 words or less.ProgramsMIMS ProgramAdmissionsGetting StartedEssaysLetters of RecommendationResumeAcademic HistoryTest ScoresProgramming ProficiencyApplication Fee WaiversFAQCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsPaths Through the MIMS DegreeFinal ProjectFunding Your EducationAdmissions EventsVisit UsRequest Information5th Year MIDS ProgramMIDS ProgramMICS ProgramPh.D. ProgramGraduate CertificatesCybersecurity ClinicLast updated:December 3, 2021Sign up for more informationFind us on FacebookFind us on XFollow us on InstagramConnect on LinkedinWatch us on YouTubeView Flickr PhotosRead our Medium PublicationCopyright 1995–2024 UC RegentsNondiscrimination|Accessibility|PrivacyTop NavigationUC BerkeleyGiveVolunteerContact UsAlumniLog inMain menuAboutMission StatementDiversity & InclusionDiversity & Inclusion ResourcesDEIBJ LeadershipHistoryFeatured ProfilesFeatured FacultyFeatured AlumniFeatured MIMS AlumniFeatured MIDS AlumniSouth HallWork at the I SchoolSubscribe to Email AnnouncementsLogos & Style GuideDirections & ParkingContact UsProgramsMIMS ProgramAdmissionsGetting StartedEssaysLetters of RecommendationResumeAcademic HistoryTest ScoresProgramming ProficiencyApplication Fee WaiversFAQCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsPaths Through the MIMS DegreeFinal ProjectChen Award2024 ProjectsFunding Your EducationFinancial AidWorking on CampusAdmissions EventsWebinar RecordingsVisit UsRequest Information5th Year MIDS ProgramCareer OutcomesCapstone Project2024 Capstone ProjectsCapstone AwardMIDS ProgramAdmissionsJack Larson Data for Good FellowshipTuition & FeesCapstone ProjectVarian AwardFall 2024 ProjectsWomen in MIDSEventsMIDS Curriculum NewsRequest InformationMICS ProgramAdmissionsMICS Student NewsTuition & FeesCapstone ProjectChang AwardJudging GuidelinesFall 2024 ProjectsRequest InformationPh.D. ProgramAdmissionsApplicant Feedback ProgramFAQApplication Fee WaiversCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsFunding Your EducationDissertationsAdmissions EventsRequest InformationGraduate CertificatesApplied Data Science CertificateFAQApproved CoursesCompletion ApplicationICTD CertificateApproved CoursesCybersecurity ClinicApplicationCoursesInformation Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course ScheduleData Science Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course ScheduleCybersecurity Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course SchedulePeopleFacultyLadder & Adjunct FacultyLecturersEmeritiStudentsMIMS StudentsMIDS Students5th Year MIDS StudentsMICS StudentsPh.D. StudentsStaffVisitorsResearchPublicationsCenters & LabsResearch AreasComputer-mediated CommunicationData ScienceDesignEntrepreneurshipHuman-computer Interaction (HCI)Information EconomicsInformation OrganizationInformation PolicyInformation Retrieval & SearchInformation VisualizationLawPrivacySecuritySocial & Cultural StudiesTechnology for Developing RegionsUser Experience ResearchCareersFor EmployersWhy Hire I School?EventsCustom Recruiting EventRequest a Resume BookFor Nonprofit and Government EmployersLeadership Development ProgramSupport the Leadership Development ProgramMailing ListFor Students & AlumniEventsMIMS EventsMIMS Office HoursMIDS Events5th Year MIDS Events5th Year MIDS Office HoursMICS EventsResourcesLeadership Development ProgramApplicationAdvisingJobscan & Applicant Tracking SystemsResume & LinkedIn ReviewNewsPress CoverageAlumni NewsI School VoicesEventsDistinguished Lecture SeriesI School LecturesInformation Access SeminarsCLTC EventsFor the I School CommunityAlumni EventsWomen in MIDS Events
