Resumes should be a succinct, honest account of your proudest professional experiences and accomplishments, and should clearly highlight your career progression.Although our students have an average of five years of work experience, the admissions committee is not looking at quantity, but rather the quality, richness, and breadth of your work experience. We value and appreciate a diversity of backgrounds in the program, and we accept candidates with a wide range of work experience.Treat your resume like a snapshot of your work experience, and then use your essays to delve deeper.Tip #1Your resume should be clear and concise. We recommend you aim for a 1–2 page resume organized chronologically by your most recent job.Tip #2Share your impact. Resumes for industry jobs tend to describe responsibilities rather than impact on a company — and impact is what we really want to learn about.Tip #3Don’t include industry jargon or acronyms that someone outside of the field might not recognize. Instead, spell things out for us — from your acronyms to your professional development and impact.ProgramsMIMS ProgramAdmissionsGetting StartedEssaysLetters of RecommendationResumeAcademic HistoryTest ScoresProgramming ProficiencyApplication Fee WaiversFAQCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsPaths Through the MIMS DegreeFinal ProjectFunding Your EducationAdmissions EventsVisit UsRequest Information5th Year MIDS ProgramMIDS ProgramMICS ProgramPh.D. ProgramGraduate CertificatesCybersecurity ClinicLast updated:December 3, 2021Sign up for more informationFind us on FacebookFind us on XFollow us on InstagramConnect on LinkedinWatch us on YouTubeView Flickr PhotosRead our Medium PublicationCopyright 1995–2024 UC RegentsNondiscrimination|Accessibility|PrivacyTop NavigationUC BerkeleyGiveVolunteerContact UsAlumniLog inMain menuAboutMission StatementDiversity & InclusionDiversity & Inclusion ResourcesDEIBJ LeadershipHistoryFeatured ProfilesFeatured FacultyFeatured AlumniFeatured MIMS AlumniFeatured MIDS AlumniSouth HallWork at the I SchoolSubscribe to Email AnnouncementsLogos & Style GuideDirections & ParkingContact UsProgramsMIMS ProgramAdmissionsGetting StartedEssaysLetters of RecommendationResumeAcademic HistoryTest ScoresProgramming ProficiencyApplication Fee WaiversFAQCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsPaths Through the MIMS DegreeFinal ProjectChen Award2024 ProjectsFunding Your EducationFinancial AidWorking on CampusAdmissions EventsWebinar RecordingsVisit UsRequest Information5th Year MIDS ProgramCareer OutcomesCapstone Project2024 Capstone ProjectsCapstone AwardMIDS ProgramAdmissionsJack Larson Data for Good FellowshipTuition & FeesCapstone ProjectVarian AwardFall 2024 ProjectsWomen in MIDSEventsMIDS Curriculum NewsRequest InformationMICS ProgramAdmissionsMICS Student NewsTuition & FeesCapstone ProjectChang AwardJudging GuidelinesFall 2024 ProjectsRequest InformationPh.D. ProgramAdmissionsApplicant Feedback ProgramFAQApplication Fee WaiversCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsFunding Your EducationDissertationsAdmissions EventsRequest InformationGraduate CertificatesApplied Data Science CertificateFAQApproved CoursesCompletion ApplicationICTD CertificateApproved CoursesCybersecurity ClinicApplicationCoursesInformation Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course ScheduleData Science Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course ScheduleCybersecurity Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course SchedulePeopleFacultyLadder & Adjunct FacultyLecturersEmeritiStudentsMIMS StudentsMIDS Students5th Year MIDS StudentsMICS StudentsPh.D. StudentsStaffVisitorsResearchPublicationsCenters & LabsResearch AreasComputer-mediated CommunicationData ScienceDesignEntrepreneurshipHuman-computer Interaction (HCI)Information EconomicsInformation OrganizationInformation PolicyInformation Retrieval & SearchInformation VisualizationLawPrivacySecuritySocial & Cultural StudiesTechnology for Developing RegionsUser Experience ResearchCareersFor EmployersWhy Hire I School?EventsCustom Recruiting EventRequest a Resume BookFor Nonprofit and Government EmployersLeadership Development ProgramSupport the Leadership Development ProgramMailing ListFor Students & AlumniEventsMIMS EventsMIMS Office HoursMIDS Events5th Year MIDS Events5th Year MIDS Office HoursMICS EventsResourcesLeadership Development ProgramApplicationAdvisingJobscan & Applicant Tracking SystemsResume & LinkedIn ReviewNewsPress CoverageAlumni NewsI School VoicesEventsDistinguished Lecture SeriesI School LecturesInformation Access SeminarsCLTC EventsFor the I School CommunityAlumni EventsWomen in MIDS Events
