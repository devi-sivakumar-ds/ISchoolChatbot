Introduction to Programming and ComputationandInfo 206B. Introduction to Data Structures and Analytics. Students may be waived out of Info 206A during the admissions process if they demonstrate sufficient competency in object-oriented programming. All students are required to take Info 206B. As these are technically rigorous courses, we want to ensure that students are well prepared for success.The Programming Proficiency Form provides us with a comprehensive picture of your programming experience. This form asks you to share the programming language(s) with which you are familiar, your level of proficiency, and how you acquired your knowledge. We expect entering students to have a basic level of skill in a high-level object-oriented language (e.g., Python, Java, C++). Info 206A and Info 206B use Python, but other languages are acceptable for admission.TipIf you don’t yet have any object-oriented programming experience, that’s OK! We recommend that you sign up for an online or in-person course right away (and include this information in your application) to show the admissions committee that you are committed to gaining this knowledge prior to beginning MIMS. It’s also in your best interest to make sure you actually enjoy and value this technical component of MIMS.There are a number of ways to gain this introductory level knowledge:Online object-oriented programming courses (check outIntroduction to Computer Science,Python, andadditional resources for self-study)In-person object-oriented programming courses at your local community college or universityCommon Questions and AnswersWhich programming languages meet this requirement?We require programming skills comparable to those obtained in an introductory level in-person or online programming course in a high-level object-oriented language, such as Python, Java, C++. Python is currently used forInfo 206AandInfo 206B, but other languages are acceptable for admission. Programming languages such as Visual Basic, C, and those languages used to implement and enhance database management systems (such as SQL) are not acceptable.Are specific programming courses required?No, but it is expected that applicants will have completed at least one introductory level in-person or online object-oriented programming course prior to the start of the MIMS program. Here are some online Python courses and self-study resources that we encourage you to explore:Introduction to Computer SciencePythonAdditional resources for self-studyAm I required to submit evidence of programming coursework completion?While you are not required to submit evidence of completed coursework, it could be in your best interest to do so, especially for candidates with limited programming or technical experience. Please upload documentation to the last question of the Programming Proficiency Form. Please also be sure to list on the Programming Proficiency Form specific coursework that you have completed or that is in progress.ProgramsMIMS ProgramAdmissionsGetting StartedEssaysLetters of RecommendationResumeAcademic HistoryTest ScoresProgramming ProficiencyApplication Fee WaiversFAQCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsPaths Through the MIMS DegreeFinal ProjectFunding Your EducationAdmissions EventsVisit UsRequest Information5th Year MIDS ProgramMIDS ProgramMICS ProgramPh.D. ProgramGraduate CertificatesCybersecurity ClinicLast updated:December 3, 2021Sign up for more informationFind us on FacebookFind us on XFollow us on InstagramConnect on LinkedinWatch us on YouTubeView Flickr PhotosRead our Medium PublicationCopyright 1995–2024 UC RegentsNondiscrimination|Accessibility|PrivacyTop NavigationUC BerkeleyGiveVolunteerContact UsAlumniLog inMain menuAboutMission StatementDiversity & InclusionDiversity & Inclusion ResourcesDEIBJ LeadershipHistoryFeatured ProfilesFeatured FacultyFeatured AlumniFeatured MIMS AlumniFeatured MIDS AlumniSouth HallWork at the I SchoolSubscribe to Email AnnouncementsLogos & Style GuideDirections & ParkingContact UsProgramsMIMS ProgramAdmissionsGetting StartedEssaysLetters of RecommendationResumeAcademic HistoryTest ScoresProgramming ProficiencyApplication Fee WaiversFAQCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsPaths Through the MIMS DegreeFinal ProjectChen Award2024 ProjectsFunding Your EducationFinancial AidWorking on CampusAdmissions EventsWebinar RecordingsVisit UsRequest Information5th Year MIDS ProgramCareer OutcomesCapstone Project2024 Capstone ProjectsCapstone AwardMIDS ProgramAdmissionsJack Larson Data for Good FellowshipTuition & FeesCapstone ProjectVarian AwardFall 2024 ProjectsWomen in MIDSEventsMIDS Curriculum NewsRequest InformationMICS ProgramAdmissionsMICS Student NewsTuition & FeesCapstone ProjectChang AwardJudging GuidelinesFall 2024 ProjectsRequest InformationPh.D. ProgramAdmissionsApplicant Feedback ProgramFAQApplication Fee WaiversCareer OutcomesDegree RequirementsFunding Your EducationDissertationsAdmissions EventsRequest InformationGraduate CertificatesApplied Data Science CertificateFAQApproved CoursesCompletion ApplicationICTD CertificateApproved CoursesCybersecurity ClinicApplicationCoursesInformation Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course ScheduleData Science Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course ScheduleCybersecurity Course CatalogFall 2024 Course ScheduleSpring 2025 Course SchedulePeopleFacultyLadder & Adjunct FacultyLecturersEmeritiStudentsMIMS StudentsMIDS Students5th Year MIDS StudentsMICS StudentsPh.D. StudentsStaffVisitorsResearchPublicationsCenters & LabsResearch AreasComputer-mediated CommunicationData ScienceDesignEntrepreneurshipHuman-computer Interaction (HCI)Information EconomicsInformation OrganizationInformation PolicyInformation Retrieval & SearchInformation VisualizationLawPrivacySecuritySocial & Cultural StudiesTechnology for Developing RegionsUser Experience ResearchCareersFor EmployersWhy Hire I School?EventsCustom Recruiting EventRequest a Resume BookFor Nonprofit and Government EmployersLeadership Development ProgramSupport the Leadership Development ProgramMailing ListFor Students & AlumniEventsMIMS EventsMIMS Office HoursMIDS Events5th Year MIDS Events5th Year MIDS Office HoursMICS EventsResourcesLeadership Development ProgramApplicationAdvisingJobscan & Applicant Tracking SystemsResume & LinkedIn ReviewNewsPress CoverageAlumni NewsI School VoicesEventsDistinguished Lecture SeriesI School LecturesInformation Access SeminarsCLTC EventsFor the I School CommunityAlumni EventsWomen in MIDS Events
